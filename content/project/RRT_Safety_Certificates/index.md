# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper uses an efficient collision checking procedure for path planning of Quadrotors/mobile robots to avoid
static obstacles and reach the goal. The collision checking process for RRT, a sampling-based motion planning algorithm, is done
by creating safety certificates around the sample nodes and then finding a viable path to the goal point through those safety
certificates. At first, the problem is solved by considering a point mass robot. This problem is extended to the multi-agent system,
where a collection of robots performs specific tasks (such as carrying a glass of fixed dimension from one place to another).
Numerical simulations and demonstrations show that the method gives a feasible path by efficiently avoiding obstacles for both
cases."
