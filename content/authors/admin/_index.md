Currently, I am pursuing [M.Tech. in Robotics and Autonomous Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/mtech-ras-curriculum/) at the [Indian Institue of Science, Bangalore, India](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). I am a graduate of Aerospace Engineering from [Punjab Engineering College](https://pec.ac.in/), Chandigarh, India. I am an awardee of the prestigious scholarship [MITACS Research Internship Program 2019](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship).

I am interested in multiagent learning and safe exploration. I am motivated to further deploying such safe policies in real world systems, which still is limited majorly limited to ideal settings. I am also interested in theoretical optimization work. Definitely, it is quite interesting to view Reinforcement Learning in the framework of non-convex non-concave optimization and hence forth deriving efficient algorithms for RL with stronger convergence guarantees and bounds.

Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at [Punjab State Aeronautical Engineering College](http://psaec.ac.in/), Patiala, Punjab, India. Prior to this, I have worked on Computer Vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Automation project under [Prof. Rene Jr Landry](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/rlandry) at the [École de Technologie Supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/), Montreal, Canada.
