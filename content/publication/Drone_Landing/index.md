# Abstract.
abstract = "To develop a fully autonomous UAV it is important that it can detect the environmental conditions, so that autonomous Navigation and Guidance can be achieved. Detection of environment can be done using various techniques and broadly can be categorized in two divisions, one is in Radio Frequency environment and another is in Radio Frequency denied environment. In RF environments detection can be done using radio waves based tools such as GPS and Radiolink between the platform and the UAV, however, in RF denied environments, such techniques cannot be used and this work presents a survey of methods using in image and signal processing, carrying out an intelligent approach based on Artificial intelligence and machine learning. Such techniques would be very robust and can work in any kind of environmental and geographical situations. There are many application fields of UAV where radio waves are not available such as in jammed environment, uncovered areas, landing applications in marine environments, ssurveillance in remote locations etc."
