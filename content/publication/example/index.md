  To develop a fully autonomous UAV it is important
  that it can detect the environmental conditions, so that
  autonomous Navigation and Guidance can be achieved. Detection
  of environment can be done using various techniques and
  broadly can be categorized in two divisions, one is in Radio
  Frequency environment and another is in Radio Frequency
  denied environment. In RF environments detection can be done
  using radio waves based tools such as GPS and Radiolink between
  the platform and the UAV, however, in RF denied environments,
  such techniques cannot be used and this work presents a survey
  of methods using in image and signal processing, carrying out an
  intelligent approach based on Artificial intelligence and machine
  learning. Such techniques would be very robust and can work in
  any kind of environmental and geographical situations. There
  are many application fields of UAV where radio waves are
  not available such as in jammed environment, uncovered areas,
  landing applications in marine environments, surveillance in
  remote locations etc.
